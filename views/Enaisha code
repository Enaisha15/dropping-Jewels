// orgianl files 
connect - local ejs is authn file 
edit.ejs? why did i add it 
feed.ejs contains students post // comments mentors feed.ejs / suppose to be the same student can post and reply as well as mentors 
mentorfeed.ejs -- {just shows post can't comment} should be landing page for the mentor after login same as feed.ejs should be the same for student landing page  
login.ejs is for student login.ejs
mentorprofile.ejs should be student profile page
// profile ejs allows to see profile and edit 
temp files
